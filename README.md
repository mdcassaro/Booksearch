# Google Book Search
> A book search using Google Books
# Criterea
In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
# Accomplished
I created a full stack app using react and Mongo DB. This app allows for the user to look up books by title and author.
